# D-RATS Renewed

This is hopefully the future home for D-RATS development. The system is being modernized to Python3 and will use the latest GTK library in python pygobject. This should give the D-RATS project a renewed lifespan on multiple platforms. Once we get the old code stable we can consider accepting feature requests.

# Description

 D-RATS is a communications tool for D-STAR amateur radio low-speed data
 (DV mode).
 It provides:
   Multi-user chat capabilities;
   File transfers
   Structured data transport (forms); and
   Position tracking and mapping.


## Installation instructions

I'm developing this on a Mac but plan to release on Linux and Windows.

### Mac Setup

### GTK3

You're going to need GTK3 support for this project, download homebrew `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`

Once you have homebrew, install gtk3

    brew install pygobject3 --with-python@2 gtk+3
